The premise of the game is that you're sitting on a toilet in a forest, and you have to throw toilet paper at zombies in order to defend yourself. It was built with the Oculus Rift, Thalmic Myo, and Unity3D game engine. Although we ended up making it to top 20 out of 300 teams, we achieved our goal of making 200+ people laugh during our demo as they saw toilet paper hitting zombies in virtual reality, from their own arm motions.

  desc_1: <a href="https://github.com/jeffreychien/pandashow" target="_blank">Github</a> / <a href="http://ignitis.io/projects/pandashow/home" target="_blank">Website</a><br>This was a hack made at the TechCrunch Disrupt Hackathon in September 2014. Basically, its a website where you click a panda and it gives you a list of trending TV shows you can watch. You then have the option to tweet or text your friends a peel link, which opens up the Peel Smart Remote app. We ended up winning Best Use of Peel API and had the chance to demo in front of 2000 people.

In the game, you ride a hoverboard along an endless ramp while dodging sharks that explode on impact and collecting cubes that increase your score. To make the game immersive, we taped a Wiimote on a longboard and used that as a controller for our hoverboard ingame, so people could actually control their characters by leaning left and right on the longboard.

  desc_1: <a href="https://github.com/victorface2/collegesurvival" target="_blank">Github</a><br>This hack was made at UC Berkeley's HackJam, a small 12 hour hackathon that was held in September 2013. I decided to make this game after taking a Math 54 midterm on linear algebra, which ended up being much harder than expected. In the game, you are a fox who attempts to fight <a href="http://math.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/f-alberto-gruenbaum" class="textlink">Professor Grunbaum</a> by shooting matricies at him, and he shoots back F's and determinants to try to hurt you back. If you get hit, your GPA decreases and the asian dad shows up, and if Professor Grunbaum gets hit, his health decreases. The trick to the game is that, like in Math 54, you can't actually win, Professor Grunbaum's health can go below 0 and there's nothing you can do about it.

  desc_1: The Stock Arbitrage Finder was a tool I wrote for fun, to see if there were any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrage" class="textlink" target="_blank">arbitrage</a> opportunities in the publicly traded stocks of the NYSE. Though the tool was a lot of fun to make and taught me a lot about accessing APIs, ultimately I discovered that almost no arbitrage opportunities exist in stocks traded on the NYSE.

  desc_1: <a href="https://github.com/victorface2/particles" target="_blank">Github</a><br>This was a project that I worked on my junior year of high school. As part of AP Computer Science, our final project was to build a game, so my friend Charlie and I built Particles, a game where you dodge constantly spawning balls that collide with each other at high velocities. The game can be played by downloading the .jar file and running it on your system.
