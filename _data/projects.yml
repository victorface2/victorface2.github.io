The premise of the game is that you're sitting on a toilet in a forest, and you have to throw toilet paper at zombies in order to defend yourself. We ended up making it to top 20 out of 300 teams, and achieved our goal of making 200+ people laugh during our demos as they saw toilet paper hitting zombies in virtual reality, from their own arm motions.

In the spirit of "hacking," to make the game truly immersive, we taped a Wiimote to the front of a longboard such that your movements on the longboard actually control your character ingame (and it was very responsive too!). We ended up taking top 10 overall, and again got a bunch of people to laugh as they saw themselves gliding down an endless virtual ramp.

  desc_1: <a href="https://github.com/jeffreychien/pandashow" target="_blank">Github</a> / <a href="http://ignitis.io/projects/pandashow/home" target="_blank">Website</a><br>This was a hack made at the TechCrunch Disrupt Hackathon in September 2014. Basically, its a website where you click a panda and it gives you a list of trending TV shows you can watch. You then have the option to tweet or text your friends a peel link, which opens up the Peel Smart Remote app. We ended up winning Best Use of Peel API and had the chance to demo in front of 2000 people.

  desc_1: <a href="https://github.com/victorface2/collegesurvival" target="_blank">Github</a><br>What is this game? I took a Math 54 (Linear Algebra) midterm that was much harder than expected, and decided to make this game. In it, you're a small fox that shoots matricies at <a href="http://math.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/f-alberto-gruenbaum" class="textlink">Professor Grunbaum</a>, who in turn shoots matrix determinants and F's back at you. If you get hit, your GPA goes down and the Asian Dad shows up, and if Professor Grunbaum gets hit, his health goes down. The trick to the game is, just like Math 54, you can't actually win - Professor Grunbaum's health will go below 0 and there's nothing you can do about it.

  desc_1: The Stock Arbitrage Finder was a tool I wrote for fun, to see if there were any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrage" class="textlink" target="_blank">arbitrage</a> opportunities in the publicly traded stocks of the NYSE. Though the tool was a lot of fun to make and taught me a lot about accessing APIs, ultimately I discovered that almost no arbitrage opportunities exist in stocks traded on the NYSE.

  desc_1: <a href="https://github.com/victorface2/particles" target="_blank">Github</a><br>This was a project that I worked on my junior year of high school. As part of AP Computer Science, our final project was to build a game, so my friend Charlie and I built Particles, a game where you dodge constantly spawning balls that collide with each other at high velocities. The game can be played by downloading the .jar file and running it on your system.
